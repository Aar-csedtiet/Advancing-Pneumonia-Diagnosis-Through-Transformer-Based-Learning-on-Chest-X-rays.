Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) Dataset

This project uses the publicly available Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset introduced by Kermany et al. (2018). 
It is one of the most widely used datasets for benchmarking automated pneumonia-detection models.

Dataset Overview: Total Images: 5,863
Format: JPEG
Imaging View: Anterior–Posterior (AP)

The dataset is divided into three standard splits: Train, Validation, and Test

Each split contains two classes: Pneumonia and Normal

Data Quality & Labeling: All radiographs were part of routine clinical examinations and underwent strict quality-control steps:
1. Removal of low-quality or unreadable scans
2. Independent grading by two expert physicians
3. A third senior expert reviewed the evaluation subset to minimise inconsistencies and annotation bias
