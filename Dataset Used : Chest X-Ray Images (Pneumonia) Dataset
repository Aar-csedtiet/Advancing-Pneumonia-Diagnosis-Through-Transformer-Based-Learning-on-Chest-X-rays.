Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) Dataset

This project uses the publicly available Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset introduced by Kermany et al. (2018). It is one of the most widely used datasets for benchmarking automated pneumonia-detection models.

Dataset Overview

Total Images: 5,863

Format: JPEG

Imaging View: Anterior–Posterior (AP)

Population: Pediatric patients aged 1–5 years

Source: Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, China

The dataset is divided into three standard splits:

Train

Validation

Test

Each split contains two classes:

Pneumonia

Normal

Data Quality & Labeling

All radiographs were part of routine clinical examinations and underwent strict quality-control steps:

Removal of low-quality or unreadable scans

Independent grading by two expert physicians

A third senior expert reviewed the evaluation subset to minimise inconsistencies and annotation bias

This careful curation ensures high diagnostic reliability, making the dataset suitable for training and evaluating machine learning models for pneumonia detection.
